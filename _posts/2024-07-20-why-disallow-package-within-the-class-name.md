## Motivation
After opening a directory it is the developers job to filter out the files that are not relevant to their task at hand. The more words to filter, the more difficult it becomes to quickly orient themselves and start making changes. Disallowing package within the class name promises to reduce this information overload.

As developers are choosing names for their classes the overall length plays a huge role in the clarity it provides. Too long and it becomes unwieldy to use in in our thoughts and conversation. Disallowing package within the class name promises to free developers to use more descriptive and relevant words.

### Encourages more descriptive/relevant words
